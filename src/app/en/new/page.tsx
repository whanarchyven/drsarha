            description: 'A study has found isotretinoin effective in treating acne in individuals undergoing masculinizing hormone therapy. Among 55 participants, 87.3% reported improvement, and 47.3% reported complete resolution of acne. The best results were achieved with cumulative doses â‰¥ 120 mg/kg. Side effects included dry skin, joint pain, and headaches. Further research is needed to determine optimal dosages and overcome treatment barriers in transgender individuals receiving testosterone.',

He noted that such warnings, while informative, can be misleading and cause unnecessary anxiety. Examples included warnings about dupilumab\'s association with T-cell lymphoma and warnings for calcineurin inhibitors and IL-17 inhibitors, which may not reflect actual risk. Hawkes emphasized the need for a balanced approach based on scientific data to avoid rejecting effective therapies due to potentially misleading warnings.',
